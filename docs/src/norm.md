# Vowel normalization

Vowel normalization routines come from a variety of sources. In the case of the Nearey normalizations, they are intended to show how a listener takes formant information (which varies not only based on vowel category, but also on factors like gender and age) and transforms them to a space where formant information is more related to vowel category. In that sense, it is a perceptually motivated routine. Other routines, like the Lobanov normalization routine (Lobanov, 1971), are more purpose driven in that their goal is just to allow vowel comparisons between speakers, regardless of whether the technique is perceptually motivated or plausible.
